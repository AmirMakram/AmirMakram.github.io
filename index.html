    <meta name="description" content="Hi, my name is Amir Makram, a software developer, born in Alexandria, Egypt in July 1997.
    I graduated from the faculty of commerce, Alexandria University, Computers and Information systems as my major in May 2019.
    After finishing my military services, I joined Information Technology Institution (ITI) and graduate at the 3rd top of my class.
    My major in the ITI is full-stack development using .NET & .NET core frameworks.
    
    Since I was a kid and I was fascinated with computers and all things about them, I used Linux since I was eight years old (my first Linux distribution was AdiosOS based on fedora 5) I was just discovered a new horizon.
    My turning point in my life was in middle school, and I had a school assignment for working with visual basic code, and with my first 'Hello World' line, that was how I knew what I want to do with the rest of my life.
    Since then, my journey started for finding my passion and what I want to code with; I tried PHP and C. After I select computers and information systems as my major in college, I tried Java, PHP again, R and Python, Python was fun. But when I saw JavaScript and C# and how they are challengeable and missy, I love them.
    The information technology institution (ITI) helped me to pursue my career after finishing my military services and put me in the way of software development using the latest technologies.
